Results
1.Human-mouse group scored 1091 with 89.64% identical amino acids
2.When comparing the human and mouse sequences with a random sequence, both sequences scored -250 with 5.41% (human-random) and 5.86% (mouse-random) of identical amino acids.
Conclusion
SOD2 sequences has great similarity between human and mouse, which shows SOD2 protein was present in the same ancestors of human and mouse.
The conservation suggests the SOD2 protein may be not a species-spesific protein.
